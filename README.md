# Corsica & Paris Trip
A running list of some notes for our trip that might prove helpful. Will keep adding to it as we come across new info.

## Corsica
The house is in **Cala Rosa** (_don’t have exact address_), looks like it’s about 8 minutes walk to the beach. Not sure which sections of the beach will be OK for us to access, might be closer.

### Porto-Vecchio
This will be the closest town. Just to the south west of the Cala Rosa neighborhood. Seems to have some nice shops, restaurants, etc.

#### Recommended Shops Nearby Porto-Vecchio
* L’Orriu (see #14 in the map above) _**Listed as a “best of” pick for produce and groceries in the Lonely Planet Guide €5-19**_
> “First and foremost, this is a treasure-trove of regional Corsican products, with shelves groaning under the weight of bottles and packets of goodies, and hams hanging enticingly from the ceiling. Better still, it has a tempting menu of bite- sized dishes (from €5), such as assiette du berger (cheese platter) or gâteau à la farine de châtaigne (chestnut cake), that you mix and match over wine by the glass (€3).”
* Sous La Tonnelle (see #20 on the map) €12-25
> “Consistently rated as one of the old town’s best restaurants, it offers a fine selection of fish and meat dishes served in a narrow interior or on a vine-clad pavement terrace. We’ll be back.”
* Version Originale (see #23 on the map) €6-13
> “Inventive, mouth-watering salads are the name of the game in this kooky den right by the harbour. It also churns out crispy paninis. With its brightly coloured chairs, steel tables and wooden deck, it’s almost trendy.”
* Le Glacier de la Place (see #17)
> “Yes, you can stumble across excellent ice cream in Porto-Vecchio. Creamy chocolate and wavy banana...and myriad other flavours scream ‘try me’ from behind the glass in this buzzing bar and ice-cream parlour, smack dab in the centre.”
