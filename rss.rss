          <title>Baltimore</title>
          <description>I lived in Baltimore for nearly 10 years and it's maybe my favorite city in America. The Wire was in production for most of the time I was living there, and it was a common sight to see actors milling about a cluster of Haddad's trucks anywhere in the city. It is, without a doubt, one of the best TV shows ever. 
   
    Is the universe sufficiently vast to contain both the empirical fact that a Faidley’s backfin crabcake is the world’s best and that Baltimore is the fifth most dangerous city in America?
   
 There aren't enough favorite buttons on the internet to express how much I love this response from the shows creator David Simon to "critics" who claim his work puts Baltimore in an unfavorable light.</description>

          <title>In the Middle with Middleman and Frameless</title>
          <description>I love Middleman. It's simple, powerful, and fast. I've been playing with Rails and Rails prototyping for a while, mostly with Serve—and with static site generators like Jekyll and Octopress for about just as long. I think Middleman is the best of all of them.</description>

          <title>Winter Crow Roosts</title>
          <description>It’s March, and the arrival of Springtime means the end of the large crow roosts. I’d never known about crow roosts before I moved into my current apartment, but apparently during the Winter crows gather in large numbers in the evening hours and then fly off to spend the whole night gathered together in one spot as a roost. Roosts can range in size from a hundered crows to hundereds of thousands of crows.</description>

          <title>24 Hours in Shenandoah: Marshall Mountain</title>
          <description>Another weekend and another chance to spend 24 hours in Shenandoah. This time I was up on Marshall Mountain in the Northern section of the park. The loop starts at the Jenkins Gap overlook around the 12 mile mark on Skyline Drive. I’ve gone both ways around on this loop and I definitely think coming back on the Appalachian Trail is the way to go. That section of the loop has the best views and there are some real choice spots for pitching a shelter up on the ridge. 
	 
	 Find the trailhead for the Mount Marshall trail just south of the Jenkins Gap overlook on the left. This part of the loop to Bluff Trail follows an old fire road, it’s broad, generally level, and perfect for quickly putting a couple miles behind you. I was lucky enough this morning to have a deer keeping pace about 20 yards ahead of me for the first mile or so, generously breaking the trail of all those annoying early morning spiderwebs I normally take right in the face. Eventually though, I guess I got to close and he scrambled up the hill to the right of the trail and was out of sight.</description>

          <title>Quicksilver</title>
          <description>To be a European Christian (the rest of the world might be forgiven for thinking) was to build ships and sail them to any and all coasts not already a-bristle with cannons, make landfall at river’s mouth, kiss the dirt, plant a cross for a flag, scare the hell out of any indigenes with a musketry demo’, and - having come so far, and suffered and risked so much - unpack a shallow basin and scoop up some muck from the river-bottom.</description>

          <title>AppleBlog Roundup 4</title>
          <description>Well, another couple weeks have gone by and it’s time for another roundup of recent articles I’ve written over at TheAppleBlog. Maybe one of these days I’ll figure out a better way to bring all my content together but until then here’s roundup number four. 
	 
		iPhone HDR: I played around with some HDR apps for the iPhone and tried out the new HDR Pro tools in photoshop CS5. In the final analysis, the iPhone camera is just a 5 megapixel cameraphone and it’s never gonna produce the kind of photos one can get with a DSLR. Never the less, constraints are good for creativity and the iPhone is still my favorite camera to have with me on a hike.</description>

          <title>24 Hours in Shenandoah: Knob Mountain</title>
          <description>I managed to get out for a quick loop hike in Shenandoah last weekend, 24 hours quick to be exact. To me, 24 hours seems to be almost the perfect length of time to be able to enjoy an easy bit of backpacking. I can head out early on a Saturday hike all day, find a nice place to spend the night, hike out in the morning, and still have time Sunday to run errands and get ready for the upcoming week. This weekend I was out on Knob mountain. 
	 
	  The trailhead starts at about the 24 mile mark on SkyLine Drive at the bottom of the Elk Wallow picnic grounds. Pick up the Appalachian Trail (38.74109 -78.31198) and start heading south. After about half a mile you connect with Jeremy’s Run Trail (38.74295 -78.31369). The AT breaks off to the left but you’ll want to stay straight and continue heading NW towards Jeremy’s Run. It’s a nice easy walk descending into the wilderness area, the trail is broad and really well maintained here with nice views into the valley to the east. I spotted a couple deer here and the trail was full of evidence of their passing.</description>

          <title>A Quick Walk</title>
          <description>I got out for a quick walk the other day, partly to check out a new trail I found recently and partly to test out the camera in my new phone (iPhone 4). The trail is only about 5 minutes away from my place, so it’s not exactly out in the middle of the wilderness. Being right next door though and only like 4 miles long makes it a great option when the mood strikes in the middle of the day. There’s also a ton of cutoff trails leading to the edges of the park so there’s lots of opportunities to explore.</description>

          <title>Heart Sutra</title>
          <description>I’ve been thinking on the Buddhist Heart Sutra quite a bit lately. If you’re not familiar with the specific aspects of Buddhist philosophy represented in this particular sutra I’ll give you the cliff notes. 
	  All things are empty: Nothing is born, nothing dies, nothing is pure, nothing is stained, nothing increases and nothing decreases. 
	 
	  It’s essentially all about the notion that everything around us (objects, phenomena, people) actually exists without any inherent substantiality. Instead their nature is derived from this interconnected web of perception and experience; nothing stands apart and nothing stands forever. At least that’s what I think it means, but what the fuck do I know.</description>

          <title>Final Codex</title>
          <description>I wrote this plug-in for Google’s Quick Search Box a while back to replicate a bit of functionality from Coda that I lost when I moved over to Espresso. The gist of the plug-in is that it lets you quickly send search queries to documentation sources for things like HTML, CSS, jQery, Python, MySQL, and so on. I do a lot of these kinds of quick looks into documentation as I’m working so having a quick and easy method for it is helpful.</description>

          <title>A New Home</title>
          <description>I’ve been meaning to dig into Tumblr themes for a while now, but I’m a total slacker so the notion’s never progressed beyond a to do item in my next pile, until now. This weekend I decided to dedicate some time to figuring out how it all worked and at least getting the shell of something I like together. After working through the process from scratch I have to say, I like it quite a bit. As far as theming goes I’d be hard pressed to imagine an approach that provides more ease and flexibility than the one the Tumblr folks have come up with. After reading through their API and crystal balling future plans, I’m also really impressed with the service as a whole. So much so that I think I’ll stay. I’ve been on my own WordPress install for quite a while now and to be honest I think it’s just overkill for me. Especially when you consider how infrequently I post.</description>

          <title>AppleBlog Roundup 3</title>
          <description>Over the last couple of weeks (OK.. so more like months, I’m a bit of a slacker) I’ve written a few posts over at TheAppleBlog and I just wanted to include them here for the sake of completeness. A few of these are on Google Quick Search Box which, while being a great little app, has frustrated me a bit with it’s lack of forward progress in Beta. I’ve recently switched over to Launchbar5 for all my GUI Ninja Tricks and I have to say I think it’s far better at the moment than QSB. If you’re into doing a lot of stuff very quickly from the keyboard, you might want to check it out. 
 QSB Video Walkthrough: I was playing around with Google Quick Search Box recently and was really surprised by all the functionality it provides. Once I got it fully set up with plugins and services, I realized it can give me just about everything I used to rely on Quicksilver for.</description>

          <title>Shenandoah</title>
          <description>I spent last weekend hiking around in  Shenandoah National Park  and despite having not been hiking for  a long time had an absolute blast. The park runs roughly north south for over 100 miles along the spine of the Blue Ridge Mountains and encompasses nearly 200,000 acres 80,000 of which are protected as wilderness areas under the National Wilderness Preservation System. Skyline drive runs the length of the park and cuts essentially right down the middle offering an abundance of scenic overlooks filled with hollows and ridges covered in timber. There’s lots of wildlife to be seen and while hiking a 12 mile loop in the largest of the parks wilderness areas I spotted a skunk, 2 grouse, a turkey and a black bear along the trail.</description>

          <title>Wikipedia is Evil</title>
          <description>Wikipedia is evil, yeah that’s right evil. The other day I was tooling around in the o’le RSS river of news when I stumbled upon a random tweet from apparent computing legend  Daniel Bernstein. Who, though I confess I’d never heard of him before (please don’t make me turn in my geek card), was apparently instrumental in getting software code recognized by the judicial branch as protected speech under the First Amendment. His message read simply:</description>

          <title>Verified Reporters</title>
          <description>I spent some time last night tracking the events unfolding in Iran following the apparent re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last 48 hours you know that there appears to be widespread doubt about the legitimacy of the election results and that supporters of Ahmadinejad’s chief opponent Mir Hussein Moussavi have been openly clashing with the government in protests across the country.</description>

          <description>So I’ve decided to go ahead and throw in my lot with the good folks over at TheAppleBlog when it comes to my rants and reviews about all things Apple, OS X and the like.

          <description>A little while ago I ran across this post from @corbett3000 about the need for greater civic involvement from the tech community. This was a call to "build stuff that matters” to help the country do more with less, keep our leaders honest, their governance transparent, and plainly put—to fix crap that’s broken.</description>

          <description>I just switched all my feed reading over to the newly released 1.6 version of NewsFire and I’m loving it.

          <title>Acceleration Curves</title>
          <description>I love OS X. It’s far and away the best operating system I’ve ever used.  There are a couple things about it though that have always been a frustration for me. Chief among them is the way movement of the mouse on your desk is translated to movement of the cursor on your screen a process handled by something called the “Acceleration Curve”.</description>

          <description>I’m lucky enough to be able to work on an OS X system at my day job but officially it’s a “Microsoft shop” with most people on Windows and our intranet powered by SharePoint. We store a lot of documents on SharePoint and it’s always a pain in the ass to have to fire up mac office to have a quick look at a .doc or .xls file. To make matters worse there are a lot of Office 2007 files that my version of mac office won’t open.</description>

          <title>QuickPukka</title>
          <description>With almost 100 feeds sitting in my RSS reader (Net News Wire) I’ve got a lot of information coming at me everyday.  When I see something that I know I’ll want to come back to later I save it as a bookmark on the social bookmarking service delicious.  I also use this service to push links to my blog (see the sidebar to the right).  To make the process of adding bookmarks a bit easier I’ve been using a mix of Quicksilver, Pukka and Apple Script.</description>
