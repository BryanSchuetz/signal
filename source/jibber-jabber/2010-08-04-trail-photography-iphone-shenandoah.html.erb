	 <p>It doesnâ€™t take much range to blow out highlights or shadows on the iPhone and scenes like this spot where I stopped for lunch on Marshall Mountain yesterday can be hard to capture. So, I resorted to some HDR which trends slightly more surreal than photorealistic but it captures the mood. At least touch to expose makes setting up for processing easy.</p>
